Sentence Similarity is the task of determining how similar two texts are. Sentence 
similarity models convert input texts into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information 
and calculate how close (similar) they are between them. This task is particularly useful for 
information retrieval and clustering/grouping.To check the sentence similarity between two paragraphs, we can implement cosine 
similarity check. Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are 
irrespective of their size. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two 
vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.
