The corona virus COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global health crisis so the effective protection 
methods is wearing a face mask in public areas according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments acrossthe world to impose lockdownstoprevent virus
transmissions. Reportsindicate that wearing facemasks while at work clearly reduces the risk of 
transmission. An efficient and economic approach of using AI to create a safe environment in a
manufacturing setup. A hybrid model using deep and classical machine learning for face mask 
detection will be presented. A face mask detection dataset consists of with mask and without mask 
images , I am using Open CV to do real-time face detection from a live stream via our
webcam. I have used the dataset to build a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision using 
Python, Open CV, and Tensor Flow and Keras. Our goal is to identify whether the person on 
image/video stream is wearing a face mask or not with the help of computer vision and deep learning.
